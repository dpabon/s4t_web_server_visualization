# Tool to estimate local temperatures changes following an increase in forest cover (Visualization results)

This repository deploys the web server for the visualization of the "Tool to estimate local temperatures changes following an increase in forest cover". Part of the [Open Earth Monitor Project](https://earthmonitor.org/). For visualization the [xcube-viewer](https://github.com/xcube-dev/xcube-viewer) is deployed with multiple changes to support 15 minutes temporal resolution and monthly composites, these changes are mainly implemented internaly handling the time dimension as a categorical variable.

The visualizer is deployed in the following link: http://141.5.123.133/viewer/?serverUrl=http://141.5.123.133:80&serverId=local&serverName=Local (setting up a propper https domain is in progress).
